# Games

Working on two games at the moment.  [Rooms With No View](https://github.com/Baavgai/ColossalCodingAdventure/tree/master/story/rooms_no_view.md) as supposed to be a minimum example, but even that got complex quick.  So, for now, we're going to be humble with one room and two moving parts.

## [Room With a Key](https://github.com/Baavgai/ColossalCodingAdventure/tree/master/story/room_key.md)

This is, I think, the simplest possible example.  We shall see...

## [Rooms With No View](https://github.com/Baavgai/ColossalCodingAdventure/tree/master/story/rooms_no_view.md)

No, it's not the most exciting name, or game, but it is short and simple and will hopefully demonstrate all that's needed for you to write your own vastly superior interactive fiction.

We're following a common, and simple, scenario in text adventures here: finding oneself somewhere and needing to escape.  The escape is achieved by solving a puzzle via interacting with the environment.  And, of course, failure is possible, else it wouldn't be much fun.

## Code

### C

C was the first language an example was written in.  It got messy, got cleaned up, and is still as simple as reasonable.  Ok, maybe not completely simple: helper functions might be for the more advanced.

### C++

Coming soon.

### Python

Python is so... not necessarily easy, but perhaps easier on the programmer.  The library supporting this example also got a little too complex for a beginner to be expected to follow.  However, the trade off is that actual implementation is exactly where we'd want it to be.  Unfortunately, as it managed to be completely declarative, there isn't a lot of room here for the coder to stretch.  A good base for the adventure writer, though.
